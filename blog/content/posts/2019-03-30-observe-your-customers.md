# Observe your customers

Recently, my team has been building some automation for another team.

This week we've run some workshops and received feedback about it.

Most of the time they would tell us if something was wrong, didn't meet their requirements or expectations.

However, one of my team observed that when people followed the `README.md`, they scrolled up and down the file trying to follow the instructions.

So he took the initiative to make some adjustments.

He improved the documentation by:
- fixing the flow and order of instructions
- simplified the setup steps

Yes this feedback was subtle, but it's just as important as that verbal or written feedback.

In the end, we need to observe and take feedback from our customers so we can continually improve their experience.
