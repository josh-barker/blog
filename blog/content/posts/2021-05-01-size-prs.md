# Size PRs

I have noticed that its easy for people to submit huge PRs, but it takes forever to understand the changes and potential bugs or security issues with it.

There are existing solutions for this problem and use fixed ranges to determine the size of change.

But, how do you determine the right ranges?

What happens when you use a different language?

Well, I set out to build a Github Application to help encourage smaller and single focused changes.

The app - (Size Prs)[https:://github.com/size-prs/docs] uses AI to categorise a Pull Request by **Kind** and **Size**.

All you need to do is install it.

No need to configure anything.

It uses a number of factors to determine the size (or complexity) of the change, and even considers the programming language.

Once labeled, you could use other Github actions to automatically close too large Pull Requests, comment on the PR, or whatever you can build.
