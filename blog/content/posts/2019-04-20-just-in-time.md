# Just In Time Delivery

Recently I became a volunteer at [Many Rooms](https://manyrooms.org.au/) to help cook food for disadvantaged people.

It's generally quite a hectic night.

We have a limited amount of time and space to prepare and cook a main meal and a desert for 50+ people.

There's a team of 5 to 8 people working on food preparation; cleaning and cutting up vegetables, making sauces, cooking meat and all kinds of things
But, as there's not much time, we have to work quickly and not be a perfectionist.

Not all the vegetables or pieces of meat need to be identical; just close enough.

It's better that people eat food that is pretty good, rather than not eating at all.

Likewise, this reminded me about work and other projects.

It's very easy to try to think about all the possible ways I could improve the code, or extend the functionality, without any feedback from the users.

I'm learning that receiving feedback early and often is incredibly beneficial, as it hones the solution to the real problems.
